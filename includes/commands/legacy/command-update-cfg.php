   * This command can be useful when the CiviCRM site has been cloned or migrated.
   *
   * The old version of this command tried to preserve webserver ownership of "templates_c"
   * and "civicrm/upload" because (when running this command as something other than the
   * web-user) `doSiteMove` clears and recreates these directories. The check took place
   * *after* `doSiteMove` had run, however, so would only report back the current user and
   * group.
   *
   * If you run `wp-cli` as something other than the web-user, it's up to you to assign
   * correct ownership of these directories.
   *
   * ## EXAMPLES
   *
   *     $ wp civicrm update-cfg
   *     Beginning site move process...
   *     Template cache and upload directory have been cleared.
   *     Database cache tables cleared.
   *     Session has been reset.
   *     Please make sure the following directories have the correct permissions:
   *     /example.com/httpdocs/wp-content/uploads/civicrm/templates_c/
   *     /example.com/httpdocs/wp-content/uploads/civicrm/upload/
   *     Success: Config successfully updated.
   *
   * @since 1.0.0
   *
   * @param array $args The WP-CLI positional arguments.
   * @param array $assoc_args The WP-CLI associative arguments.
